# Testing Guide for UF Lab Attendance System

This guide explains how to run and maintain the automated tests for the **UF Lab Attendance System**. The suite covers **unit**, **integration**, and **end‚Äëto‚Äëend (E2E)** tests using **Jest** and **Playwright (Electron)**.

## Folder Structure

```
UF-Lab-Attendance-System/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tests/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ unit/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ integration/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ e2e/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ helpers/

‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ setup/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README-TESTING.md
```

### What each folder is for

- `tests/unit/` ‚Äì Pure logic with no I/O or UI; fast feedback.
- `tests/integration/` ‚Äì Multiple modules working together (e.g., DataManager + persistence).
- `tests/e2e/` ‚Äì Black-box UI tests through Electron with Spectron.
- `tests/helpers/` ‚Äì Reusable test utilities and data generators.
- `tests/fixtures/` ‚Äì Static JSON files used by tests.
- `tests/setup/` ‚Äì Jest config, environment bootstrap, and teardown scripts.

---

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- macOS, Linux, or Windows
- For E2E tests: ability to launch an Electron window (CI runners may require xvfb on Linux).

---

## Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install --save-dev jest spectron electron @testing-library/jest-dom jest-environment-jsdom
```

> The same command exists in this README and in the repo root for convenience.

---

## Running Tests

### Run all tests
```bash
npm test
```

### Run a specific suite
```bash
npm run test:unit
npm run test:integration
npm run test:e2e  # runs Playwright
```

### Watch mode (useful during development)
```bash
npm run test:watch
```

### Coverage report
```bash
npm run test:coverage
```
Coverage is written to the `coverage/` folder and includes `text`, `lcov`, and `html` reports.

---

## Configuration Details

- **Primary config** lives in `package.json` under the `jest` field.
- A secondary, explicit Jest config is also included at `tests/setup/jest.config.js` and is useful for editor tooling or direct jest invocations:
  - `testEnvironment: "node"`
  - `setupFilesAfterEnv: ["<rootDir>/tests/setup/setupTests.js"]`
  - `testTimeout: 30000`
  - coverage reporters: `text`, `lcov`, `html`
  - mocks and timers are cleared/reset/restored between tests

### Setup & Teardown

- `tests/setup/setupTests.js` bootstraps a clean test data directory and **mocks Electron** so unit/integration tests can run without launching a real app window.
- `tests/setup/teardown.js` removes temporary test data after the run.

---

## End‚Äëto‚ÄëEnd (Spectron) Notes

- E2E tests launch an Electron `Application` and interact with the UI.
- Ensure your app can boot in a minimal test mode with environment variable `NODE_ENV=test`.
- In CI on Linux, run under a virtual display:
  ```bash
  xvfb-run -a npm run test:e2e  # runs Playwright
  ```

> These E2E tests use Playwright‚Äôs Electron driver.

---

## Writing Tests

### Conventions

- Test files end with `.test.js` and live under `tests/**`.
- Keep unit tests fast and deterministic‚Äîno real I/O or timers.
- Prefer helpers from `tests/helpers/testUtils.js` for file I/O within the sandboxed `test-data/` folder.
- Use fixtures from `tests/fixtures/` for canonical sample datasets.

### Example Patterns

- **Unit**: validate `DataManager` methods (`addStudent`, `getStats`, etc.).
- **Integration**: simulate a ‚Äúday in the lab‚Äù workflow from student add ‚Üí sign‚Äëin ‚Üí sign‚Äëout ‚Üí reporting.
- **E2E**: verify UI loads, inputs validate UFIDs, admin modal auth flow, responsive behavior.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Electron fails to start**: ensure your local environment can open a window; try `xvfb-run` on headless Linux.
- **Module not found (`data.js`)**: tests reference `../../data.js`. If running tests standalone, provide your app‚Äôs `data.js` module or adjust import paths.
- **Port conflicts**: make sure no other test run is holding OS resources.
- **Flaky timing**: prefer `await testUtils.waitFor(ms)` over arbitrary `setTimeout` in tests.

---

## Continuous Integration (optional)

Example GitHub Actions workflow:

```yaml
name: tests
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 20
      - run: npm ci
      - run: xvfb-run -a npm test
```

---

## Maintaining Fixtures

- `sample-students.json` and `sample-attendance.json` are small but representative datasets.
- Update them when the app‚Äôs schema changes. Keep timestamps ISO‚Äë8601.

---

## Tips

- Keep mocks near where they‚Äôre used; global Electron mocks live in setup.
- Use `test:verbose` to quickly find slow or failing specs.
- Prefer **small, focused** tests; add E2E only for top‚Äëvalue user flows.

Happy testing! üéØ

## Migration Notes (from Spectron)

- Replaced Spectron with `@playwright/test` using the Electron driver (`_electron`).
- New config: `tests/e2e/playwright.config.ts`
- E2E command: `npm run test:e2e` (runs Playwright)
- API mapping examples:
  - `app.client.getTitle()` ‚Üí `expect(page).toHaveTitle()`
  - `$(selector)` ‚Üí `page.locator(selector)`
  - `isDisplayed/isEnabled` ‚Üí `toBeVisible()/toBeEnabled()`
  - `browserWindow.setSize(w,h)` ‚Üí `page.setViewportSize({ width, height })`
